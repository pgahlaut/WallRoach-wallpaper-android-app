# WallRoach-Android-firebase-Realtime-Database

WallRoach is an Android App which uses Firebase as its backend to serve high quality Wallpapers to its users.

This was my personal project which I have decided to make Open Source.
The code still uses my firebase configuration files which you will have to replace with your own, like # 'google-services.json'
in the app folder has to be replaced with your firebase project's google-services.json.

Same goes for the firebase storage bucket URLs.
The Code assumes that the all the Wallpapers strored in the Firebase Storage and Firebase Realtime Database are in a particular 
format.
